Task : Fine tune a large language model (LLM) for performing named entity recognition (NER) task on an automotive dataset.
So to begin with, I downloaded the data given and using python libraries used the relevant columns for processing and converting it into tabular representation.
While readind the data, figured out some relevant entities. The entitites were : ['Manufacturing Company','Model','Part','Failure Issue','Repairing part','Replaced Part']
